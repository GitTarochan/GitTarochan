### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


- ğŸ”­ I'm currently dedicating myself to student life and programming. I love learning and am always curious about new technologies and ideas.

- ğŸŒ± Lately, I'm particularly fascinated by web3.0. I'm looking forward to sharing the interesting aspects and challenges I encounter in my learning journey.

- ğŸ‘¯ One of my hobbies is watching movies and TV dramas. I'm a big fan of "Les MisÃ©rables" and "Modern Family"! I'm drawn to touching stories and heartwarming family dramas.

- ğŸ’¬ Feel free to message me if you want to talk about my interests or activities. I'm excited to share new knowledge and collaborate on projects.

- ğŸ˜„ I'm often referred to as Taro-chan.

- âš¡ Fun fact: As a child, I had a strong aversion to wasabi and insisted on having sushi without it. However, one day, I accidentally consumed a lot of wasabi and became hooked on its spicy kick. Now, wasabi is an essential part of my sushi experience! It's fascinating how our tastes can change.
